// request. A cross-request cached client makes concurrent requests on a freshly
// spun-up isolate await a connection promise that belongs to a different
// request's context, which the runtime flags as "hung" and returns as
// Error 1101 (it self-heals once the connection is established, hence the
// intermittent failures right after a deploy or on isolate cold-start).
//
// `cache()` scopes the client to a single request: reused within the request
// (so the lazy proxy below does not open a new connection on every property
// access), and discarded between requests (no illegal cross-request reuse).
